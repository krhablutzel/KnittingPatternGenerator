### Examples

##### Rule 30

![Rule 30, 25x25 stitches](/examples/rule30.png)

![A knitted example.](/examples/rule30knitted.png)

We knitted rule 30 as an example! This
When knitting from the front, we knitted the pink and purled the yellow, and when knitting from the back, we did the reverse (every other row).

To recreate this pattern, enter 25 for the width and height and 30 for the seed.

##### Rule 25

![Rule 30, 25x50 stitches](/examples/rule25.png)

![A knitted example.](/examples/rule25knitted.png)

We started knitting a narrow scarf from rule 25 and these stripes already have such a fun pattern down the center!
We knitted two rows for each individual row in the diagram, alternating knitting and purling rows in a KPPK pattern to create the stripes.
When knitting from the front, we knitted the pink and purled the yellow, and when knitting from the back, we did the reverse (every other row).

To recreate this pattern, enter 25 for the width and height and 30 for the seed.



##### Rule 80

![Rule 30, 10x80 size](/examples/rule80.png)

We could imagine knitting 3-4 stitches for each cell in this diagram (both width and height) to really emphasize that beautiful diagonal!

To recreate this pattern, enter 10 for the width, and 80 for the height, and 80 for the seed.
