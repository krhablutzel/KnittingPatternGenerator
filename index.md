##### Rule 30

![Rule 30, 25x25 stitches](/examples/rule30.png) ![A knitted example.](/examples/rule30knitted.png)

We knitted rule 30 as an example! The image simply cannot capture the incredible texture of this pattern in 3D. When knitting from the front, we knitted the white and purled the purple, and when knitting from the back, we did the reverse (every other row).

To recreate this pattern, enter 25 for the width and height and 30 for the seed.

##### Rule 25

![Rule 25, 25x25 size](/examples/rule25.png) ![A knitted example.](/examples/rule25knitted.png)

We started knitting a striped scarf from rule 25, and these stripes already have such a fun pattern down the center!
We knitted two rows for each individual row in the diagram, alternating knitting and purling rows in a KPPK pattern to create the stripes. At the accent stitches for each row, we knitted the reverse stitch compared to the rest of the row.

To recreate this pattern, enter 25 for the width, 25 for the height, and 30 for the seed.

##### Rule 57

![Rule 57, 30x50 size](/examples/rule57.png)

Rule 57 creates creates a symmetrical diamond shield pattern. The stripes along the sides eventually switch to checkers! This pattern could make a fun accent on the front of a hat or a square of a quilt.

To recreate this pattern, enter 30 for the width, 50 for the height, and 57 for the seed.

##### Rule 182

![Rule 182, 36x36 size](/examples/rule182.png)

Rule 182 creates a fun triangle pattern! This would look excellent in two contrasting yarn colors. Check out rule 181 as well for a less symmetrical version of these triangles.

To recreate this pattern, enter 36 for the width and height and 182 for the seed.

##### Rule 80

![Rule 80, 10x80 size](/examples/rule80.png)

We could imagine knitting 3-4 stitches for each cell in this diagram (both width and height) to really emphasize that beautiful diagonal!

To recreate this pattern, enter 10 for the width, 80 for the height, and 80 for the seed.

##### Rule 45

![Rule 45, 34x50 size](/examples/rule45.png)

Some of these patterns could add a truly chaotic flair to your projects! This pattern begins with some simple stripes, then the chaos spreads in a pyramid pattern.

To recreate this pattern, enter 34 for the width, 50 for the height, and 45 for the seed.
