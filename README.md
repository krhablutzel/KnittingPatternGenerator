# The Unconventional Knitting Pattern Generator

For HackSmith 2021

Inspired by the beautiful stripes, triangles, and seashell-like patterns of cellular automata, we built this knitting pattern generator to provide some unconventional inspiration for your next project!

Patterns are generated in Python and visualized using matplotlib, as hosted in our [Replit repository](https://replit.com/@kdmallen/blub#main.py). The generator is also accessible from our [website](https://github.com/krhablutzel/KnittingPatternGenerator/tree/gh-pages)!
